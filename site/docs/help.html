<h3>Game Play</h3>

<p>To start a new game, ensure that the "remote" radio button is selected, select "2" or "4" for "Players" near the bottom of the page, fill in your "Name", ensure that the server "URL" is correct (it will be), and click the "New Game" button. The "Game ID" will be filled in with a string you can give to the other player(s) to join.</p>

<p>To join a game already in process, select the "remote" radio button, fill in your "Name", paste in the "Game ID" given to you by the person who started the game, ensure that the "URL" is correct, and click the "Join Game" button.</p>

<p>After the "New Game" or "Join Game" request has been returned by the server, you can "Resign" at any time. Otherwise, the server will notice when the game is over, either because after placement it is not possible to resolve, or because one of the player's home circles cannot be changed."

<p>You can also use the page as a board for a local game, and control all players locally. To do this, select the "local" radio button, fill in the "Names" with a comma-separated list of player names (or let it default), and click "New Game".</p>

<h3>Node Colors</h3>

<p>Your nodes are colored <span style='font-weight: bold; color: green;'>green</span>. In four-player games, the resolver's nodes, if you are not the resolver, are colored <span style='font-weight: bold; color: red;'>red</span>.</p>

<h3>Placement Phase</h3>

<p>Each turn begins with the Placement phase. Fill in each of the numbered boxes near the top of the page with a color and node name, e.g. "wb1" to put a white stone on node "B1". You can also choose "white" or "black" for the "Placement Click Color", and click on the node. The selected input box will advance after you click.</p>

<p>When you've filled in all the input boxes with valid colors for empty nodes, the "Place" button will become enabled, and you can click it to place the stones.</p>

<h3>Resolution Phase</h3>

<p>If there are resolutions to be made, those stones will be outlined in <span style='font-weight: bold; color: red;'>red</span>. If there are not, play will proceed with placement for the next turn.</p>

<p>To make a resolution, click on one of the red-outlined stones. It's outline will be changed to <span style='font-weight: bold; color: orange;'>orange</span>, and the places it can move will be outlined in <span style='font-weight: bold; color: green;'>green</span>. Click on one of the green-outlined locations to make the move. Click on the orange-outlined selected stone to cancel the selection. Continue until there are no longer any red-outlined stones, and the game switches to placement phase for the next turn.</p>

<p>I have not yet implemented detection of the end of the game. Do that yourself for now.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>At the bottom of the screen is a table containing the history of the game. Click the "Undo" button to undo the last resolution move or placement.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>The numbers in parentheses next to the input boxes are the score for each player. The first number is the number of stones in the (outer) home circle for that player's region. The second number is the total number of stones in that player's region (only relevant if there is a tie in the home circle).</p>

<h3>Source Code</h3>

<p>Clicking the "GitHub" link near the bottom of the page will open the source code repository in a new browser tab/window.</p>

<h3>TODO</h3>

<p>Multi-player games over the internet.</p>
